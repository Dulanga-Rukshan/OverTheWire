                        this is to find a the file and check whether it is human readable or not 

                find ./ -type f -size 1033c -exec cat {} \; 
                        this is to run cat command to see which data contain in that file

level 12 to 13
flag for level 11 - FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
                first i used command is 
                step 01 
                        *    xxd -r data.txt output
                        this reverse convert the hexdump data back into the binary data so i can analyse the binary data what 
                        it has been compressed 

                            Gzip: the bytes often start with 1F 8B (hex).

                            bzip2: often begins with ASCII BZh.

                            xz: begins with bytes corresponding to the ASCII \xFD7zXZ.

                            Zip / PKZip: begins with ASCII PK.

                            tar: tar itself doesnâ€™t have a single fixed first magic sequence for all tarfiles, but an archive 
                            might be a tar wrapped in a compression format.

                            Plain text: lots of printable ASCII characters; you might see your password directly.
                            Knowing these signatures helps you choose the appropriate decompression step.

                step 02 
                        
                        then i checked file type using 
                            file output 

                            it is gzip file
                                cp output gzip.gz

                        so i decompress it by 
                                gzip -d gzip.gz
                                cp gzip bzip2.bz2
                        
                        then i recheck it again, it is bzip compressed file. so decompress it 
                                bzip2 -d bzip2.bz2
                        
                        then i recheck it again it is a gzip file also 
                                cp bzip2 gzip2.gz 
                                gzip -d gzip2.gz

                        now it is a tar archive file
